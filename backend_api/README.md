# Flask + Google NLP API + Datastore (The Backend)

This sample demonstrates how to use the [Google Cloud Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language) and [Google Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/) inside a Flask application, all running on [Google App Engine Flexible Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

It will create a simple Python flask app that serves some REST endpoints. The application will communicate with GCP's 
NLP API for analysis and Datastore for a NoSQL database. The endpoints created will later be used by the Notebook 
frontend.


## Using the Cloud Shell
Head over to the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and make sure you are in the desired project.

Open the Cloud Shell by clicking this button on the top right of the console:

![img.png](../docs/img.png)

Here, you can enter commands to interact with GCP.

## App Engine and API Setup (done for you already)
**Note: We have done this step for you, so feel free to just read through it.** 

Create your App Engine application:

    gcloud app create

You will have to select a region. Choose one that is close to your location.

Next, we will enable the two GCP APIs needed to run our application. The first is the Natural Language API. The second is Datastore.

You can do all of this directly in the Cloud Shell or you setup Cloud SDK on your local machine as well (see below on how to do that)

    gcloud services enable language.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable datastore.googleapis.com

**Note: Okay, back to your part!**
You can do all of this directly in the Cloud Shell or if you setup Cloud SDK on your local machine as well (see below on how to do that)

## Cloning the code into Cloud Shell

If you use a private repository, you will need to [log in to GitHub](../README-private-clone.md) first. \
Run the following commands to clone the GitHub repository to your cloud shell (replace it with your clone/fork url):

    gh auth login (follow the steps to connect to your GitHub)
    git clone https://github.com/was111607/sample-gcp-nlp-flask.git (replace with your forked version)

Change directory to the backend directory:

    cd sample-gcp-nlp-flask/backend_api

## Creating a Service Account key
We are going to use the default App Engine service account to run our app. We get its key so that we can access it when 
testing the app locally.

Get the project ID and save it into an environment variable

    export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value core/project)


Get the key.json for the App Engine service account:

    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account \
    ${PROJECT_ID}@appspot.gserviceaccount.com

<span style="color:red">
<h1>
<b>
IMPORTANT: Keep this key.json a secret. You should never commit this file ever.
</b>
</h1>
</span>

## Running the backend on Cloud Shell with a Virtual Environment
To run our app through the cloud shell (that is, not deploying it just yet), we should create a virtual environment. This is just an environment where we install the specific dependencies needed by the project and can run the code.

### For *nix systems

Install virtualenv:

    pip install virtualenv

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    virtualenv -p python3 env

If you do `ls` now, you will see an `/env` folder created which contains the virtual environment. 

Start your virtual environment:

    source env/bin/activate

Install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    (Other dependencies are flas_restx, google-cloud)

Start your application via cloud shell using your virtual environment:

    python main.py


### For Windows

Install virtualenv:

    pip install virtualenv

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    python -m virtualenv .

If you do `ls` now, you will see an `/Scripts` folder created which contains the virtual environment. 

Start your virtual environment:

     .\Scripts\activate

Install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Start your application via cloud shell using your virtual environment:

    python main.py

Visit the link generated ('Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/') to view your application running locally. Test it out! (click on the link from cloud shell)

You should be presented with a [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) page. This page will allow you to interact with the backend REST API easily. In the examples we have given you can make a post request where we apply sentiment analysis on some given text and then save it to [GCP Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/quickstart)
Try sending the sentence "Today is a great day for coding!" in the post request. Then execute the get request.

Press `Control-C` on your command line when you are finished to stop the application.

 
## Deactivating your virtual environment
When you are ready to leave your virtual environment:

    deactivate

## Deploying to App Engine

Deploy your application to App Engine with the following command. Please note that this may
take several minutes.

    gcloud app deploy

Visit `https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot.com` to view your deployed application.

You can continue to make new versions of the application and deploy them with the above command.

## Running Locally (Optionally)
Alternatively, if you do not wish to use the Cloud Shell you can setup the Cloud SDK on your local machine instead.
This will allow you to run the app entirely from your local machine instead of the cloud shell console.

Download the Cloud SDK here https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive

Once downloaded and installed login using:

    gcloud auth login

Link to the correct project (using the wrong project might accidently bill you instead). Extra documentation https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing

    gcloud init

For mac/linux:
    Follow the instructions above as normal. 

For Windows:
    Follow the instructions above as normal but replace `export` with `set`.
    To activate your VM, do `\venv\Scripts\activate`.

If you get an error on Windows similar to this: `running scripts is disabled on this system` then run the following command:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process

## Get Started Coding!
Alright, now it's your time to start coding. Take a look at the main.py to see how it works, and how you should improve it!

For those curious about Data Science, jupyter notebooks (.ipynb or iPython Notebook files) are an essential part of experimentation. You can test out different AI/ML models on different data much quicker using them, compared to using regular .py files. Feel free to experiment with different methods of topic analysis in TopicAnalyser.ipynb, or try using different data. 
When you're finished experimenting, consider making your experimented code available in TopicAnalyser.py, and make TopicAnalyser.py part of your API in main.py.
(NOTE: this is only one optional path you can take with your project)
