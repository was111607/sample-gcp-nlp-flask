    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Natural Language API has several methods for performing analysis and annotation on your text. Each level of analysis provides valuable information for language understanding. These methods are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment analysis** inspects the given text and identifies the prevailing emotional opinion within the text, especially to determine a writer's attitude as positive, negative, or neutral. This method returns the sentiment of the text as a whole as well as the sentiment of individual sentences within it. Sentiment analysis is performed through the analyzeSentiment method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entity analysis** inspects the given text for known entities (Proper nouns such as public figures, landmarks, and so on. Common nouns such as restaurant, stadium, and so on.) and returns information about those entities. This includes a Wikipedia link (if applicable), the entity type and the salience (a measure of the relevance of the entity to the entire text). Entity analysis is performed with the analyzeEntities method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entity sentiment analysis** inspects the given text for known entities (proper nouns and common nouns), returns information about those entities, and identifies the prevailing emotional opinion of the entity within the text, especially to determine a writer's attitude toward the entity as positive, negative, or neutral. An example of how this might be used is when presented with a sentence that contains a number of different emotions; for example, \"I liked the food but the service was terrible\". Entity analysis is performed with the analyzeEntitySentiment method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntactic analysis** extracts linguistic information, breaking up the given text into a series of sentences and tokens (generally, word boundaries), providing further analysis on those tokens. For each word in the text, the API tells you the word's part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) and how it relates to other words in the sentence. Syntactic Analysis is performed with the analyzeSyntax method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content classification** analyzes text content and returns a content category for the content. Content classification is performed by using the classifyText method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each API call also detects and returns the language, if a language is not specified by the caller in the initial request. A full list of supported languages can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if you wish to perform several natural language operations on given text using only one API call, the annotateText request can also be used to perform sentiment analysis and entity analysis.\n"
